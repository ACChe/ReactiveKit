# ReactiveKit

__ReactiveKit__ is a collection of Swift frameworks for reactive and functional reactive programming.

* [ReactiveKit](https://github.com/ReactiveKit/ReactiveKit) - A core framework that provides cold Stream and hot ActiveStream types and their derivatives -  Operation, Observable and ObservableCollection types.
* [ReactiveFoundation](https://github.com/ReactiveKit/ReactiveFoundation) - Foundation framework extensions like type-safe KVO.
* [ReactiveUIKit](https://github.com/ReactiveKit/ReactiveUIKit) - UIKit extensions (bindings).

## Observable

`Observable` type represents observable mutable state, like a variable whose changes can be observed. To provide Observable, just initialize it with the initial value. To change its value afterwards, update `value` property.

```swift
let name = Observable("Jim")
name.value = "Jim Kirk"
```

To observe changes, register an observer with `observe` method.

```swift
name.observe { value in
  print(value)
}
```

You can also bind Observables to other Observables, like the ones on UIKit objects provided by ReactiveUIKit framework:

```swift
name.bindTo(nameLabel)
```

## ObservableCollection

`ObservableCollection` is a type similar to Observable, but used for encapsulating a collection (array, dictionary or set) in order to observe fine-grained events done to the collection iself. Events generated by ObservableCollection contain both the new state of the collection (the collection itself) plus the information about what elements are inserted, updated or deleted. 

```swift
let names: ObservableCollection(["Steve", "Tim"])

names.observe { e in
  print("array: \(e.collection), inserts: \(e.inserts), updates: \(e.updates), deletes: \(e.deletes)")
}
```

You work with the ObservableCollection like you'd work with the collection it encapsulates.

```swift
names.append("John") // prints: array ["Stevet", "Tim", "John"], inserts: [2], updates: [], deletes: []
names.removeLast()   // prints: array ["Stevet", "Tim"], inserts: [], updates: [], deletes: [2]
names[1] = "Mark"    // prints: array ["Stevet", "Mark"], inserts: [], updates: [1], deletes: []
```

ObservableCollection can be mapped, filtered and sorted. For example, when we define

```swift
let numbers: ObservableCollection([2, 3, 1])

let doubleNumbers = numbers.map { $0 * 2 }
let evenNumbers = numbers.filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }
let sortedNumbers = numbers.sort(<)
```

Modifying `numbers` will automatically update derived arrays:

```swift
numbers.append(4)

Assert(doubleNumbers.collection == [4, 6, 2, 8])
Assert(evenNumbers.collection == [2, 4])
Assert(sortedNumbers.collection == [1, 2, 3, 4])
```

With ReactiveUIKit, ObservableCollection can be bound to UITableView or UICollectionView. Just provide a closure that creates cells to the bindTo method.

```swift
let posts: ObservableCollection<[Post]> = ...

posts.bindTo(self.tableView) { indexPath, posts, tableView in
  let cell = tableView.dequeueCellWithIdentifier("PostCell", forIndexPath: indexPath) as! PostCell
  cell.post = posts[indexPath.row]
  return cell
}
```

Subsequent changes done to the ObservableCollection will then be automatically reflected in the table view.

## Operation

`Operation` type is used to represents asynchronous work that can fail. You can provide Operations using `create` function. It has one argument - an observer through which you send results.

```swift
func fetchImage(url: NSURL) -> Operation<UIImage, NSError> {
  return create { sink in
    Alamofire.request(.GET, url, parameters: [:]).response { request, response, data, error in
      if let error = error {
        sink.failure(error)
      } else {
        sink.next(UIImage(imageWithData: data!))
        sink.success()
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can also create Operations that immediately succeed:

```swift
let fakeImageFetch = Operation<UIImage, NSError>.succeeded(with: UIImage(imageNamed: "dummyPhoto"))
```

Or fail:

```swift
let fakeImageFetchFailure = Operation<UIImage, NSError>.failed(with: NSError(...))
```

To perform the operation, just register the observer with `observeNext` method:

```swift
fetchImage(url: ...).observeNext(on: Queue.Main.contex) { image in
  imageView.image = image
}
```

With ReactiveUIKit, you can also bind the result to the UIKit view:

```swift
fetchImage(url: ...).bindNextTo(imageView)
```

Each call to `observe` or `observeNext` method performs separate work. To share the result of a single call, use  `shareNext` method.

```swift
let image = fetchImage(url: ...).shareNext(on: Queue.Main.context)

image.bindTo(imageView1)
image.bindTo(imageView2)
```

Methods `observeNext`, `shareNext` or `bindNext` fire when the Operation sends next result. Operation can fail without producing any result. To recover from a failure, you can use `flatMapError` transformation. For example, if image fetch fails, we would like to print the error and fallback to a default image:

```swift

fetchImage(url: ...)
  .flatMapError { error in
    print(error)
    return Operation.succeeded(with: UIImage(imageNamed: "dummyPhoto")!)
  }
  .bindNextTo(imageView.rImage)
```

## Streams

Observable, ObservableCollection and Operation are all streams that conform to `StreamType` protocol. Streams can be transformed, for example:

```swift
func fetchAndBlurImage(url: NSURL) -> Operation<UIImage, NSError> {
  return fetchImage(url: url).map { $0.blurred() }
}
```

Or combined:

```swift
func authenticate() -> Operation<Token, NSError>
func fetchCurrentUser(token: Token) -> Operation<User, NSError>

...

authenticate().flatMap(.Latest) { token in
  return fetchCurrentUser(token)
}.observeNext(on: Queue.Main.context) { user in
  print("Authenticated as \(user)")
}
```
